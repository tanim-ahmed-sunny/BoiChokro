 Boichokro (বইচক্র)

Read. Reuse. Reduce Waste.

Boichokro is a modern, eco-friendly web platform designed to give books a second life. By facilitating book swaps, sales, and donations, we aim to build a circular economy for knowledge while significantly reducing the environmental footprint of the publishing industry.

 Our Mission
Every reused book saves paper, water, and energy. Boichokro (meaning "Book Circle") connects readers to ensure that no book ends up in a landfill when it could be in someone's hands.
